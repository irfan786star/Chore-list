To Do List

The BACKGROUND:

Add your tasks and activities. Sort your completed and incomplete tasks, or simply view all with the navigation select menu. 

This project was made with the idea of helping users organise their day by jotting down their tasks. Check when completed, delete when not needed.  

I used Vanilla JS, along with the usual HTML/CSS. 

PROBLEMS?
There was an issue I came across when adding the tasks at the beginning of the implementation in JS. The page kept refreshing when adding tasks. I researched around and implemented 'event.preventDefault()' , which successfully stopped the refresh.

REDEFINITION?
I could implement local storage to save the data entered, but I find the app works just fine without.
